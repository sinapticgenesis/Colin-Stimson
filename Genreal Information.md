# * ABOUT ME*
-----
I spend most of my time either working, studying, or playing with my dog. However I do have certain hobbies which I enjoy indulging in. 

# Interests and Hobbies

My hobbies include:
- Chess
- Gaming
- Tinkering
- Reading
- Aikido

I rarely diverge from these simple hobies and pleasures; however, when I have time I often try branching out to new expierences and try to learn new perspectives.
